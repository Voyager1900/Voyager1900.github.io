        <h1>Liquid Entropy Interactive Experience Research </h1>

        <img src="img1.png" alt="website screenshot" />
        
        <h3> 1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>

        <p> The first thing I notice is lighting shifting when I use mouse to interact.</p>

        <h3> 2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Open the url</li>
            <li>Observe the scene appeared</li>
            <li>Mouse stay on the website</li>
            <li>Mouse moving to the left and to the right, up and down</li>
            <li>Observe the way of the light moving on the website</li>
            <li>Moving the mouse to follow the light</li>
            <li>Read what’s on the control panel</li>
            <li>Turn the mouse size down; Moving the mouse circling around on the page</li>
            <li>Turn the speed up</li>
            <li>Moving the mouse circling around on the page</li>
            <li>Increase the delay feedback</li>
            <li>Moving the mouse to stay on the page</li>

        </ol>


        <h3> 3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with? </h3>

        <p>Moving the mouse and observe the effect it creates.</p>

        <h3> 4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>

        <p>Try moving the mouse from different directions and at different speeds. </p>

        <h3> 5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>

        <p>Let the audience try out different control settings, and engage with the whole aesthetic experience.</p>

        <h3> 6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>

        <p>The whole page is subjected to interactive change, so audience will most inevitably hover their mouse somewhere in the page and naturally engage in the interaction.</p>

        <h3> 7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times) </h3>

        <p>I find out the experience should be interacted with mouse movement almost immediately, and then after about half a minute I noticed there’s a control panel on the top right side.</p>

        <h3> 8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>

        <p>The audience will find out very soon that each time they move the mouse, they create a totally different image, and each moment distinguished from the all the other. This gives the audience the motivation to experiment with the control options once they notice it.</p>





        <h3> 9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>

        <p>The experience refers moving image. </p>

        <h3> 10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>

        <p>Just moving the mouse.</p>

        <h3> 11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>

        <p>Openminded and being creative, be experimental.</p>

        <h3> 12) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>

        <p>When I look at the effect I create on this website for too long and I feel a lit bit dizzy, especially when I turn the speed up in the control panel. It would be better if they give for example a warning sign when click into this section of the website for people with conditions like epilepsy.</p>

        <h3> 13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying? </h3>

        <p>I find the effect after I stop moving the mouse satisfying, my screen becomes a melting mirror and I can see the ripple effect I created and see if that’s what expected. </p>
